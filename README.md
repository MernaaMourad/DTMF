This project isn an embedded system for checking the validity of password and outputs either correct or error on LCD and also for setting a new password.
This code was done using codevision AVR for a project.
HW needed is :Atmega16A microcontroller -LCD- 8870 DTMF - Mic 
The input is DTMF tone that was captured by DTMF 8870 and then the output of the DTMF was sent to Micrcontroller atmega16 results(sucess/error) displayed on LCD.
